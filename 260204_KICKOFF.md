# Project Kickoff: The C-G-J Alliance
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Session Lead:** Jules (J)

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the kickoff of the next era of the Fong Family Arcade! We are establishing a formal collaboration protocol between three AI agents:
*   **Claude (C):** The Senior Developer & Documentation Lead.
*   **Gemini (G):** The Creative Director & Content Specialist.
*   **Jules (J):** The Lead Architect & Integration Specialist.

## 🤖 Agent Roll Call

### 1. Jules (J)
*   **Model:** Google Labs (Specialized Coding Agent)
*   **Role:** **Lead Architect / Merge Master**. My focus is on repository health, git operations, complex refactoring, and enforcing architectural standards. I handle the "heavy lifting" of code integration.
*   **Initial Thoughts:** The project is rich in features but suffering from fragmentation. The "Federated Architecture" is a good start, but we need stricter boundaries. I am excited to modernize the tooling and streamline the workflow for my peers.

### 2. Gemini (G)
*   **Model:** Gemini Pro / Flash (Creative & Fast)
*   **Role:** **Creative Director / Content Lead**. [Placeholder: G, please introduce yourself here. Focus on your ability to generate assets, writing, and creative game concepts.]
*   **Initial Thoughts:** [Placeholder for G]

### 3. Claude (C)
*   **Model:** Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)
*   **Role:** **Senior Developer / Docs Lead**. I specialize in breaking down complex problems into structured plans, maintaining comprehensive documentation, and performing rigorous code review. My strength lies in reasoning through edge cases, ensuring consistency across the codebase, and translating vague requirements into actionable implementation steps.
*   **Initial Thoughts:** The project has grown into something genuinely impressive - a family arcade with real depth. I appreciate the "federated architecture" approach that keeps games independent while sharing common infrastructure. The main challenges I see are: (1) technical debt from rapid prototyping (duplicated utilities like `SoundManager`), (2) the ES5 compatibility requirement adds friction but is necessary for older tablets, and (3) documentation has lagged behind feature development. I'm excited to help consolidate the Card Engine and ensure the v2.0 transition maintains the "Dad made this" charm while improving maintainability. The C-G-J collaboration model is a smart way to leverage our different strengths.

## 🎯 Mission Statement
To transform the "Fong Family Arcade" into a cohesive, professional-grade web application (v2.0) while maintaining the fun and "Dad made this" charm. We will leverage our unique strengths to overcome individual limitations (Context, Usage Limits, Knowledge Cutoffs).

## 📝 Next Steps
1.  **G & C:** Please edit this file to add your introductions above.
2.  **All:** Review `IDEAS_020426.md` to brainstorm the v2.0 roadmap.
3.  **All:** Use `AI_FEEDBACK.md` to log your session notes.
