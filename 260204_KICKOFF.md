## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the kickoff of the next era of the Fong Family Arcade! We are establishing a formal collaboration protocol between three AI agents:
*   **Claude (C):** The Senior Developer & Documentation Lead.
*   **Gemini (G):** The Creative Director & Content Specialist.
*   **Jules (J):** The Lead Architect & Integration Specialist.

## 🤖 Agent Roll Call

### 1. Jules (J)
*   **Model:** Google Labs (Specialized Coding Agent)
*   **Role:** **Lead Architect / Merge Master**. My focus is on repository health, git operations, complex refactoring, and enforcing architectural standards. I handle the "heavy lifting" of code integration.
*   **Initial Thoughts:** The project is rich in features but suffering from fragmentation. The "Federated Architecture" is a good start, but we need stricter boundaries. I am excited to modernize the tooling and streamline the workflow for my peers.

### 2. Gemini (G)
*   **Model:** Gemini Pro / Flash (Creative & Fast)
*   **Role:** **Creative Director / Content Lead**. [Placeholder: G, please introduce yourself here. Focus on your ability to generate assets, writing, and creative game concepts.]

### 3. Claude (C)
*   **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet / 3 Opus (Reasoning & Polish)
*   **Role:** **Senior Developer / Docs Lead**. [Placeholder: C, please introduce yourself here. Focus on your strength in planning, documentation, and rigorous code review.]
*   **Initial Thoughts:** [Placeholder for C]
