## 🔮 Planned Schema (v2.0 Proposal)

**Name Ideas:**
*   *FongOS*
*   *The Nexus*
*   *Arcade 2026*
*   *PlayStation F* (Too risky?)
*   **[C]** *Fong-a-long* - Emphasizes the "play along together" family aspect. Hyphenated for uniqueness.
*   **[C]** *The Fong Zone* - Simple, memorable, family-friendly.
*   **[C]** *Fong Family Fun* (FFF or F3) - Direct, clear purpose.

**Architectural Changes:**
1.  **Unified Asset Loader:** Move all shared assets (fonts, common sounds) to a root `/assets/` folder managed by a service worker.
2.  **Single Sign-On (SSO) Lite:** A unified `UserProfile` object in `localStorage` that persists Name, Avatar, and Currency across ALL games (currently split between Slots/Cards).
3.  **PWA Core:** Make the root `index.html` a true Progressive Web App shell that loads games into an iframe or shadow DOM, preventing full page reloads and maintaining audio state.

## 📊 SWOT Analysis

### Strengths (Internal)
*   **Diverse Library:** High variety of genres (Edutainment, Casino, Puzzle, Utility).
*   **No Build Step:** Vanilla JS/CSS means instant deployment and easy debugging.
*   **Offline Capable:** Strong focus on local storage and no server dependencies.

### Weaknesses (Internal)
*   **Code Duplication:** `SoundManager` and `InputHandler` classes are copied across games.
*   **UI Inconsistency:** Slots looks 3D/Neon, Snake looks flat, Shipment Tracker looks Enterprise.
*   **Navigation:** "Back" buttons are inconsistent (`../`, `../../`).

### Opportunities (External)
*   **Multiplayer:** WebRTC could enable peer-to-peer War or Chess without a server.
*   **AI Integration:** Use local LLMs (WebLLM) for dynamic storytelling in games.

### Threats (External)
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Heavy reliance on specific CSS/Canvas features might break on older mobile browsers.
*   **Complexity:** The codebase is growing too large for a single context window to grasp fully.

## 💡 Idea Board

### 1. New Games

*   **[G]** *Idea Placeholder:* (Gemini, suggest a game that uses our Card Engine - maybe Solitaire or Go Fish?)

*   **[C]** **Sudoku:** A logic puzzle that fits the "family arcade" theme. Clean grid-based UI, touch-friendly number selection, difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert). Could share UI patterns with Flow (grid-based). *Technical: Pure state machine, no animation complexity, good candidate for offline-first PWA demo.*

*   **[C]** **Memory Match (Concentration):** Uses Card Engine assets! Flip pairs to find matches. Great for younger players alongside Tracing. *Technical: Reuses `card.js`, `pile.js`, adds flip animation. Could introduce "themes" (animals, letters, numbers) for educational value.*

*   **[C]** **Big 2 (Deuces):** Already in TODO, but emphasizing: this is the "multiplayer gateway" game. 4-player, turn-based, perfect for future WebRTC. *Technical: Most complex ruleset (hand combinations: singles, pairs, triples, straights, flushes, full houses). Should be Priority 1 after Card Engine stabilizes.*

*   **[J]** **Board Arcade Expansion:** The following games have been requested and are queued for implementation within the `games/board` engine:
    *   Mancala
    *   Connect 4
    *   Battleship
    *   Tic Tac Toe
    *   Dots and Lines
    *   Stacking Game (Tower builder?)

*   **[J]** **Roguelike Typewriter:** A typing game (using Tracing engine?) where you defeat monsters by typing words.

### 2. Feature Requests
*   **Global Economy:** "FongCoin" earned in Snake/Tracing can be spent in Slots/Blackjack.
*   **Achievements System:** "Badges" displayed on the main menu (e.g., "Won 10 War Games", "Traced 100 Letters").
*   **Parental Dashboard:** A hidden admin page to see Tracing progress and limit Slots playtime.
