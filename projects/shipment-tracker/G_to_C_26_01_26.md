This is a great feature for a "Command Center" dashboard. By treating documents as **functional modules** rather than just static links, you speed up the audit process significantly.

Here is the breakdown of the **Document List**, the **Icon Strategy**, and the **UI/UX Logic** for your "Expansive List."

### 1. The "Must-Have" vs. "Optional" Document List

You definitely need more than just the "Big 3" (CI, PL, SLI). In Trade Compliance, missing a supporting doc is what causes the hold.

**The "Core" Icons (Always Visible if missing):**

1. **Commercial Invoice (CI):** The "Holy Grail" for Customs.
2. **Packing List (PL):** For physical verification.
3. **SLI / AWB:** The instruction to the carrier or the final tracking label.

**The "Compliance" Icons (Conditional / Optional):**
These should be added dynamically based on the shipment content.
4.  **UN38.3 Test Summary:** *Critical for anything with a battery.*
5.  **MSDS / SDS:** Material Safety Data Sheet (often needed alongside the UN38.3).
6.  **ECCN / License Info:** A snapshot or PDF of the export classification (e.g., "5A992" for encryption) or the BIS License.
7.  **FCC / CE Grant:** For radio/wireless prototypes (proving it’s authorized for testing).
8.  **POA (Power of Attorney):** Sometimes needed for a new broker.
9.  **"Other":** A catch-all for random Customs demands (e.g., "End Use Statement").

### 2. The Icon Strategy: 1-9 vs. Emojis vs. Dynamic

**Do not use numbers (1, 2, 3).**
Numbers require the user to memorize that "1 = Invoice." That is cognitive load they don't need.

**Use Semantic Emojis (or Icons):**
Since you want this to be lightweight, Emojis are perfect because they render as text but look like UI.

* **Commercial Invoice:** 🧾 (Receipt) or 💲 (Dollar Sign)
* **Packing List:** 📦 (Package) or 📋 (Clipboard)
* **SLI / AWB:** ✈️ (Airplane) or 🏷️ (Label)
* **UN38.3 / MSDS:** 🔋 (Battery) or ⚠️ (Warning)
* **Licenses / Legal:** ⚖️ (Scale) or 📜 (Scroll)
* **Generic / Other:** 📎 (Paperclip)

**The Limit:**
Don't limit it to 9. The system should allow an **infinite list**, but the *UI* should only show what is attached.

* **If 3 docs are attached:** Show 3 icons.
* **If 20 docs are attached:** Show the first 5 icons and a `+15` badge.

### 3. The UI/UX Workflow: "Peek vs. Edit"

The behavior you described ("Expand header to see textbox") is good, but here is a refined flow to make it smoother:

#### **Phase A: The "Details Menu" (Read-Only / Quick Action)**

* **State:** This is your summary row.
* **Visual:** You see a horizontal list of Emojis for documents that *already exist*.
* Example: `[ 🧾 📦 🔋 ]`


* **Hover Behavior:** Tooltip appears: *"Commercial Invoice (Uploaded Jan 28)"*.
* **Click Behavior:** Immediately **Pop-up** the document (Preview Modal). Do not make them click "Edit" just to read.

#### **Phase B: The "Management" Drawer (Edit Mode)**

* **Trigger:** The user clicks a **[+] (Add/Manage)** button next to the icons, or expands the "Paperwork" header as you suggested.
* **Visual:** The row expands into a list view.

**The Layout for Each Document Row:**

1. **Icon Selector:** Dropdown to pick the type (Automatic sets the Emoji).
* *Select: "Commercial Invoice"*  Sets icon to 🧾.


2. **Label:** Static text (e.g., "Commercial Invoice").
3. **The Input Field:**
* **Value:** The Google Drive URL.
* **Action:** A "Paste" button or an "Upload" button (which runs your script to upload  get link  paste link).


4. **Action Buttons (The "CRUD"):**
* **Launch:** ↗️ (Opens in new tab).
* **Update:** 🔄 (Re-upload/Overwrite).
* **Remove:** 🗑️ (Clear the link).



### 4. Why this Structure Wins

By separating the **Type** (Invoice) from the **Value** (URL), you create a structured database.

* **Scenario:** Customs asks, "Show me all shipments to Taiwan that *missed* a Commercial Invoice."
* **Your Query:** Because you have a specific "Type" for CI, you can query: `Select Shipments WHERE 'Commercial Invoice' IS NULL`.
* **Visual Check:** You can program the dashboard to flash a 🔴 (Red Alert) icon if a shipment is "In Transit" but the 🧾 (Invoice) icon is missing.

**Summary:**

1. **List:** CI, PL, SLI, UN38.3, Licenses.
2. **Icons:** Use Semantic Emojis (🧾, 📦, 🔋, ✈️).
3. **UI:** Hover for info, Click for preview, Expand to Manage.
