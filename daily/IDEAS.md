**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** DRAFT

## Layout Customization
-   "I want to create a page that will taking a newsfeed, weather feed, and have preassigned and custom assigned games on the home screen."
-   "I want to be able to customize the layout with the settings and keep it, sections first then the blocks in the sections."
-   "I didn't describe these ideas to G since I don't want you to implement the new ones. i want you to add them into the ideas files for this project."

## Planned Features (Phase 2+)
-   Customizable drag-and-drop layout.
-   Persist layout settings in `localStorage`.
-   Add more games to the command center.
-   Integrate real news/weather API (backend fetcher).
