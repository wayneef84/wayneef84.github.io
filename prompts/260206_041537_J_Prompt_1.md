# Prompt: Initial Project Overhaul - Founding & Forging

**User Request:**
Initial project overhaul
the name will be Founding & Forging instead of Founding & Forging or Founding & Forging. Please update everywhere that is and note in the changelog G attributed to this name change. This will be the first step of project overhaul

the next steps is what you determine what to do next and do what you can.

when you are done, give me a prompt to G. I will upload the github after you push your branch to main and then I will ask G to create a Prompt for a well rested C to start.

Please start recording the prompts I give you, C or G into a folder /prompts/ and label your prompts in a YYMMDD_HHMMSS_X_Prompt_Y.md (UTC AND X is J/C/G and Y a sequential number starting at 1. Add this to the onboarding or somewhere where the other two will follow.

Not only the prompt but what your plans were and what you did to execute them. thanks!

Go project Overhaul!

Here are the best words starting with **FO** and ending with **NG** (wrapping "FONG") that fit the arcade/dev vibe:

**The Top Contenders**

* **FO**rgi**NG** (Forging)
* *Vibe:* Creation, building, blacksmithing code into games. Very strong for a developer portfolio.
* *Title:* **The Fong Forging**


* **FO**undi**NG** (Founding)
* *Vibe:* The origin, the base, the establishment.
* *Title:* **The Fong Founding**


* **FO**ldi**NG** (Folding)
* *Vibe:* Specific to the Card Games section (Poker/Blackjack).
* *Title:* **The Fong Folding** (or **Fong@Folding** like the distributed computing project)



**The Strategic & Technical**

* **FO**cusi**NG** (Focusing) - *Precision and aim.*
* **FO**rmatti**NG** (Formatting) - *A bit dry, but accurate for the Docs section.*
* **FO**rtifyi**NG** (Fortifying) - *Great if you add a Tower Defense game later.*
* **FO**rcasti**NG** (Forecasting) - *Planning the roadmap.*

**The Abstract**

* **FO**rmi**NG** (Forming)
* **FO**steri**NG** (Fostering)
* **FO**llowi**NG** (Following)

**FO**rgi**NG** seems like the winner for the overall "Project Overhaul" theme—you are forging a new system with J.

Shall we slot one of these into the prompt for J, or stick with **Fong Infinite**?

Here is the comprehensive **Project Overhaul Kickoff Prompt** designed for J (Jules). It segments the work into clear architectural, navigational, and feature-level tasks as requested.

You can copy and paste the block below directly to J to start the session.

# **Project Kickoff: The "Overhaul" Protocol**

**Context:** We are initiating a full structural and functional overhaul of the repository. You (J) are acting as the Lead Architect with unlimited context. The goal is to evolve the site from a simple list into a robust portfolio and utility engine.

**Objective:** execute a three-phase overhaul focusing on Repository Organization, Main Site Navigation, and a comprehensive upgrade to the "MD Reader" utility.

---

## **Phase 1: Architecture & Organization**

* **Repo Restructure:** Analyze the current file tree. Propose and execute a file movement plan to organize loose files.
* *Requirement:* Define a clear schema (e.g., `/games/{genre}/{game_name}`, `/projects/{project_name}`, `/assets/shared`).


* **AI Documentation Update:**
* Update `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new structure.
* Establish `JULES.md` as the "Living Architecture" document, tracking decision logs and the current directory map.



## **Phase 2: Main Site Navigation (`index.html`)**

* **Enhanced Filtering:** The current "All, Games, Projects" filter is insufficient.
* *Action:* Expand filtering logic to support sub-categories: **Cards**, **Board Games**, **Arcade**, **Puzzle**, etc.
* *Projects:* Ensure the "Projects" category isolates larger apps (like Shipment Tracker) and links directly to their specific landing pages.


* **UI/UX:** Ensure the new categories are easily accessible (e.g., a secondary sub-filter row or a dropdown) without cluttering the interface.

## **Phase 3: MD Reader 2.0 (`projects/md-reader/`)**

The MD Reader is a high-value tool that needs significant maturation. Please implement the following feature set:

1. **Universal "Translator" Engine:**
* Auto-detect and convert non-standard formats (BBC Code, different Markdown variants) into clean HTML.
* **UI:** Add a "Translator Toggle" at the top (source/filter style) to switch view modes instantly.


2. **Large File Safety:**
* **Safety Check:** If a file exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 1MB), prompt the user: *"This is a large file. Load anyway?"* to prevent accidental freezes.
* **Dynamic Loading:** Implement "Infinite Scroll" or partial loading chunks for these large files so the DOM doesn't crash.


3. **Persistence & History:**
* Use `localStorage` to remember the **Last Opened Document**.
* Maintain a "Recent History" list (Last X docs, user-adjustable) for quick navigation.


4. **Navigation & Search:**
* **Sidebar/Menu:** Re-implement the "Browse by Category" list (as seen in previous iterations) so users can browse the repo contents easily.
* **Menu Toggle:** Add a dedicated Menu/Hamburger button to toggle this sidebar (it is currently missing).
* **Search:** Add a client-side search bar to filter the repo's file list instantly.


5. **Visual Fixes:**
* Add sufficient `padding-bottom` to the reader container so the last lines of text aren't cut off or sitting on the bezel.



**Immediate Next Step:**
Please acknowledge this brief. Begin by analyzing the current `index.html` and `projects/md-reader/app.js` to map out the Phase 1 moves. Present the **New Directory Schema** for approval before moving files.

You are right—I jumped the gun. You asked to **segment the items** first, and I went straight to the final output. Also, I need to be more explicit about the "No" items (the missing features you identified: **No** menu toggle, **No** search).

Here is the **Segmentation Strategy** first, breaking down your request into clear buckets for J. Following that is the **Refined Kickoff Prompt**.

### 📋 The Segmentation (The "Checklist")

**1. The "No" Items (Critical Missing UI):**

* **Missing:** No Menu Option Toggle Button (Hamburger menu).
* **Missing:** No Repository Search (Client-side file search).
* **Visual Defect:** Text in MD Reader sits too low (needs bottom padding).

**2. Navigation & Taxonomy:**

* **New Categories:** Split "Games" into specific genres: **Cards**, **Board Games**, **Arcade**, etc.
* **Project Behavior:** Clicking the "Project" category should not just filter the grid; it should trigger/load the dedicated **Project Landing Page** (`projects/index.html`).

**3. MD Reader 2.0 (The "Surprise Win" Upgrades):**

* **Translator Engine:** Auto-convert BBC Code + other Markdown variants.
* *UI:* Toggle capability (Source/Filter style) at the top.


* **Large File Safety (The "Crash Prevention"):**
* *Prompt:* "This is large, load anyway?" warning.
* *Tech:* Dynamic/Partial loading (Infinite Scroll) for big files.


* **Persistence (Memory):**
* Re-open the **Last Opened Doc** on visit.
* Keep a history list of **Last X Opened Docs** (User adjustable).


* **File Browser:** Re-implement the "List of docs by categories" sidebar (feature regression from previous versions).

**System Instruction: Project Overhaul Kickoff (The "J" Protocol)**

**Role:** You are **Jules (J)**, Lead Architect.
**Mission:** Execute a structural and functional overhaul of the **Founding & Forging**, specifically targeting the Root Navigation and the MD Reader Utility.

**Phase 1: The "No" Items (Priority Fixes)**
*You identified critical missing UI elements. Restore them immediately:*

1. **Menu Toggle:** Implement a visible **Hamburger/Menu Button** in the main UI (it is currently missing). This controls the sidebar visibility.
2. **Search Engine:** Implement a client-side **Repo Search** bar. Users must be able to find files by name/path instantly.
3. **Visual Polish:** Add `padding-bottom` to the MD Reader container. The text is currently getting cut off or sitting uncomfortably close to the screen bezel.

**Phase 2: Navigation & Taxonomy**
*Refine how we organize content in `index.html`:*

1. **Expanded Categories:** The simple "All / Games / Projects" filter is too broad. Implement sub-categories: **Cards**, **Board Games**, **Arcade**, **Puzzle**.
2. **Project Landing:** When the "Project" filter/category is selected, do *not* just filter the grid. Instead, configure it to load the dedicated **Project Landing Page** (`projects/index.html`).

**Phase 3: MD Reader 2.0 (The "Super-Reader")**
*Upgrade the `projects/md-reader/` app into a robust documentation tool:*

1. **Format Translator:**
* Auto-detect and convert **BBC Code** and standard **Markdown** variants into HTML.
* **UI:** Add a toggle switch at the top (similar to the Source/Filter buttons) to switch between "Raw" and "Translated" views.


2. **Safety & Performance:**
* **Guardrails:** If a file is >1MB (or a set line count), prompt the user: *"Large file detected. Load?"*
* **Infinite Scroll:** Implement partial loading. Render the first chunk immediately and append the rest as the user scrolls to prevent DOM freezing.


3. **Persistence (LocalStorage):**
* **Auto-Resume:** Automatically load the **Last Opened Document** on startup.
* **History:** Maintain a "Recent Docs" list (Last X items, adjustable in settings).


4. **Sidebar Browser:** Restore the "Browse by Category" file list in the reader sidebar so users can navigate the repo without leaving the reader.

**Execution Order:**

1. Analyze `index.html` and `projects/md-reader/app.js`.
2. Confirm the directory structure for the new categories.
3. Begin with **Phase 1 (The "No" Items)**.

*Please acknowledge and present the plan for Phase 1.*
