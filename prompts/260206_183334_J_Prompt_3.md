Before you code. Please plan to upgrade project a. Please mention any todos I haven't included

S or Sprunki. I want to add more themes or phases. Can you start that. I want to make each character adjustable somehow which leads to a custom character creation.

Customer editable sprunkis
Since I can't upload, it would be need to have a build your own sprunki feature where it'll save the sprunki. The neat thing is you can export your sprunki in a QR code and import sprunkis the same way. I'd like to be able to import images or assets directly but right now it might have to be a URL and a crop box value set so the game can take an image and pick a section.
The user should be able to select this

Exclusivity
QR reading and creating is a library that's exclusively for project S right now but will be available in the future


Scanning...
If you can include an ocr function for mobile devices to be used like input / keyboard that would help for future projects. It needs to scan QR codes, 128 code, eccn and other standard barcodes. I want to be able plug my phone in and have it scan and input to a computer
