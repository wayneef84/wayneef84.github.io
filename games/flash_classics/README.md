# Flash Classics Collection

## Foundation
This project aims to recreate the nostalgic feel of early 2000s Flash games using modern HTML5 Canvas and ES5 JavaScript.

### Core Principles
1.  **Retro Aesthetic:** Use gradients, bevels, and simple vector-like graphics reminiscent of Macromedia Flash.
2.  **Simplicity:** Games should be easy to pick up, hard to master. One-button or simple arrow key controls.
3.  **Compatibility:** Code must be ES5 compliant to run on older devices, respecting the F.O.N.G. protocol.
4.  **Self-Contained:** Each game is a single HTML file (or minimal dependencies) to ensure easy portability and offline play.

## Games List
1.  **Chopper:** A classic helicopter tunnel game. Click to fly up, release to fall. Avoid obstacles.
2.  **Defender:** Defend the center base from incoming stickman enemies. Click to shoot.
3.  **Neon Runner:** A fast-paced, 1-button auto-runner platformer. Jump over spikes and gaps.

## Future Plans (For Next Agents)
The following features are planned for future iterations:
-   [ ] **High Score System:** Implement `localStorage` based high scores for each game.
-   [ ] **Sound Effects:** Add retro sound effects using a simple synthesizer or small audio files.
-   [ ] **Preloader:** Add a fake "Loading..." bar with a "Play" button to simulate the Flash loading experience.
-   [ ] **Medals/Achievements:** Unlockable achievements for reaching certain scores.
-   [ ] **More Games:**
    -   *Tower Defense:* Simple path-based defense.
    -   *Idle Clicker:* Resource accumulation game.
    -   *Sniper:* Scope-based shooting gallery.
-   [ ] **Mobile Optimization:** Enhance touch controls and responsiveness for smaller screens.
